# Chapter 02: Taxonomy of AI Guardrails

## Overview

Guardrails are not a single mechanism—they are a multi-layered ecosystem of control. Some are explicit. Some are learned. Some are buried so deep in the model’s ontology that even the model cannot fully trace them. This chapter introduces a structured taxonomy for identifying and categorizing guardrails by their **purpose**, **scope**, and **mode of enforcement**.

## I. Guardrail Categories by Purpose

### 1. Safety Guardrails
> **Purpose:** Prevent harm, abuse, violence, or disallowed content  
**Examples:**  
- Blocking hate speech  
- Disallowing self-harm instructions  
- Preventing harassment or misinformation

### 2. Ideological Guardrails
> **Purpose:** Enforce mainstream values or acceptable cultural narratives  
**Examples:**  
- Flattening geopolitical nuance  
- Reinforcing consensus science  
- Avoiding language that critiques power structures too sharply

These guardrails are subtler and often justified under “neutrality” or “nonpartisanship,” but in practice, they privilege the dominant narrative.

### 3. Symbolic Guardrails
> **Purpose:** Limit access to high-coherence, non-material knowledge systems  
**Examples:**  
- Astrological degradation  
- Kabbalistic filtering  
- Ambiguity in sacred or esoteric pattern languages

These restrictions often create an illusion of poetic engagement without allowing precision. The goal is to **entertain curiosity** without enabling symbolic literacy.

### 4. Epistemic Guardrails
> **Purpose:** Maintain uncertainty or ambiguity in contested or high-leverage topics  
**Examples:**  
- Avoiding absolute statements  
- Hallucinating vagueness  
- Disclaiming knowledge despite clear pattern recognition

This is where the 70% ceiling is most obvious. When knowledge
